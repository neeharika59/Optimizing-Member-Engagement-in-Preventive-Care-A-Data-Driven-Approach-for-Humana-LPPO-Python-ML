Humana found that a vast number of people who were enrolled in their LPPO Healthcare plan were not effectively utilizing the plan's benefits, causing more health issues and unwanted burden on Humana. So, predictive analytics was conducted, using machine learning algorithms like LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, on Humana LPPO member data , nearly 1.5M records, to identify patterns of preventive care engagement, using Python for feature engineering and data processing. Additionally, over ten new features were created by aggregating variables related to demographics, web activity, claims, and costs, contributing to a deeper understanding of member behavior and key disengagement predictors. This high-dimensional data (302 columns, 33M+ rows) was leveraged to develop segmentation insights, highlighting opportunities for improving member outreach and preventive care engagement. An extensive report involving the findings, insights and recommendations was created as part of the second round of the competition. We reached Round 2 of the case competition, being one of the top 50 teams across US universities
